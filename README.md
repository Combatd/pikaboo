## Background
During the past few months alot of people around the world have started to reflect on experiences that they use to take for granted. The daily interactions and the small conversations. The friends that they had grown apart from before the pandemic. 

Our Snap Mini seeks to bring back these relationships by using the popular game Pokemon

Since the word for friend in Japanese is Tomodachi we decided to name our snap mini “Poke-Dachi”
